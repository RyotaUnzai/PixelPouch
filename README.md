# PixelPouch
PixelPouch is a Technical Artist–oriented pipeline tool
for developing, debugging, and running Python tools for DCC applications
such as Houdini and Maya.

It focuses on a VSCode-centric workflow and provides:
- Python code execution from VSCode
- debugpy-based debugger attachment to DCC processes
- utility tools to improve daily TA workflows

The goal of PixelPouch is to make DCC tool development
faster, safer, and easier to maintain in real production environments.
